## My story
Currently I am studying Computer Science **in the USA** after receiving a **_full-ride scholarship_**. For 4 years I have been working as a **teacher** in several English learning schools, but I was always interested in challenging myself with tasks. That's why I decided to finish my career in English teaching, and dive into CS.
